An inflater contains a snapshot of the tool-state. The image// is a binary file and the inflater is an XML file. When Xmodeler is started// you will be promted for the image file to use. If you select a pre-saved// image then there is an expectation that the inflater will be in the same// folder. Together the image and inflater allow the exact point at which the// system was saved to be recreated. Saving of image and inflater files is// intended to be very fast.xmf.saveState(xmf.homeDir()+"/example_image.img",   @Operation(initArgs)     format(stdout,"Restart~%",[]);    Root::Console := xmf.javaClass("console.Console");    // Create the console...    Console();    // Create the browser tree. This is set as part of the image creation in BootConsole.xmf    Console.CONSOLE.setRoot(XEditor::getBrowserTree(Root))  end);
